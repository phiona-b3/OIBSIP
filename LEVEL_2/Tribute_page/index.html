            <h3>Oladiwura once said:</h3>
            <p id="body-quote">
              “What makes you happy at the end of the day in the nonprofit space is not earning millions of dollars, or Naira. Fulfillment comes from seeing a woman learn a skill and use that skill to get <br />a job—changing that woman’s life, the life of her family, and bringing prosperity to her immediate community.”
